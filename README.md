## <h1 align="center" id="heading">🔍 AI Makerspace Midterm - RAG Application</h1>

### Outline:
#### Step 1) Deploy a Hugging Face Space with a simple Chainlit Q&A App using GPT-3

   Because this is general time suck that is the app shell that wraps the RAG application. DevOps is not my forte.

#### Step 2) RAG (Data, Embeddings, Vector Store, Langchain, Prompt Template)
   Leverage the lessons on RAG using LangChain, set things and test in the notebook
#### Step 3) Answer the 2 Questions (Test, Tweek, Repeat)
   Adjust as much as possible to get the two questions to answer correcdtly
#### Step 4) RAGAS some metric (Changed the Retriever)
   A before and after from basic to final RAG: targeted to improve the Ragas Answer Correctness score.

### Steps to Run:
1. Create a Python 3.11 environment
2. Go the python notebook and run the jupyter notebook to see the RAG pipleine construction
3. Go to Hugging Face to run the deployed Chainlit App.

# Build 🏗️
- The python notebook to see the RAG Pipeline: MikeC Midterm.ipynb (see above)  
- The python script with RAG Pipeline with Chainlit App: app.py (see AppSandbox above)

# Ship 🚢
- The notebook was merged and integrated into the Chainlit App.
- To host this on Hugging Face, a Space was created, the application code and associated files were copied to the cloned directory
- The space is a Docker container securely hosted by Hugging Face.
