### Outline:

#### Problem

Professionals often face difficulties in adequately preparing for meetings where active participation is crucial. The complexity and diversity of information required for effective participation can make preparation time-consuming and overwhelming.

#### Why it‚Äôs a Problem

Engagement in company meetings, events, and interviews demands varying depths of knowledge, ranging from detailed specific information to a broad understanding of multiple topics. This necessitates extensive research and preparation, which can be particularly challenging due to the time required and the organizational skills needed. With increasing professional demands, the ability to efficiently prepare for engagements is compromised, leading to decreased job satisfaction and productivity.

#### Solution

It functions by monitoring your schedule, identifying upcoming engagements, and automatically compiling crucial summaries, key information, pending issues, and relevant background details. Initially, Prepr will operate as a chatbot, providing essential information for your appointments. Future versions will evolve into a more dynamic AI agent capable of offering not only information but also coordination support.
