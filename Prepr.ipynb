Running a SaaS (Software as a \\nService) application across multiple cloud providers can offer benefits like \\nredundancy, flexibility, and cost optimization, but it also presents several \\nchallenges. Here are some of the key challenges SaaS vendors face when \\noperating in multiple cloud environments:- Complexity and Heterogeneity: \\nEach cloud provider has its own unique infrastructure, services, and APIs. \\nManaging and coordinating resources across multiple clouds can be \\ncomplex and require expertise in each platform.- Cost Management: Each \\ncloud provider has its own pricing model and cost structure. Keeping track of \\ncosts, optimizing resource allocation, and avoiding unexpected expenses can \\nbe a significant challenge. Tools and strategies for cost control are essential.- \\nSecurity and Compliance: Managing security across multiple clouds requires \\na comprehensive approach. You need to ensure that each cloud provider's \\nsecurity features are effectively configured and that data privacy and \\ncompliance requirements are met in all locations.- Performance and Latency: \\nDealing with varying network latencies and performance characteristics in \\ndifferent cloud regions can be challenging. You may need to implement \\nsolutions such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and load balancing to \\nmitigate latency issues.- Vendor Lock-In: Avoiding vendor lock-in is difficult \\nwhen running in multiple clouds. You must design your architecture to be as \\ncloud-agnostic as possible and be prepared for the potential migration of \\nservices or data between providers.- Monitoring and Management: \\nCentralized monitoring and management tools are critical for tracking \\nperformance, diagnosing issues, and managing resources effectively. \\nImplementing consistent monitoring and management across multiple \\nclouds is a challenge.-. Disaster Recovery and Redundancy: Designing and \\nimplementing disaster recovery and redundancy strategies that work across \\nmultiple cloud providers is essential. This ensures that your SaaS remains\",\n",

For all the \\nbenefits that it brings over monolithic application architectures, they expose \\ndevelopers to all sorts of tough distributed systems problems, making it non-\\ntrivial to build applications that are consistent, scalable, and resilient. \\nWouldn\\'t it be great if you could stop worrying about all possible failure \\nscenarios and race conditions in your system such as charging customers \\ntwice, users withdrawing more cash than they have, and selling a single ticket \\nmultiple times? \\n \\nIn this session, we introduce the open-source system \"Restate\" \\n(https://restate.dev/), a new type of foundation for transactional applications, \\nbased on *distributed durable async/await*: \\n- Restate offers powerful building blocks for applications, like persistent \\npromises, stateful RPC handlers, reliable RPC & messaging, and durable \\ntimers. \\n- Under the hood, Restate executes your applications in a resilient and low-\\nlatency event-driven manner, giving you all the benefits of event-driven \\napproaches, without any of the complexity: Your code is still a familiar long-\\nrunning RPC application. \\n- Write business logic as if infrastructure failures don\\'t exist; the durable \\nasync/await mechanism transparently handles all those failure. \\n- Write Lambda functions as if they\\'re long-running apps, letting Restate \\nintelligently manage suspensions and re-invocations during wait times. \\n- And much more.'],\n",
